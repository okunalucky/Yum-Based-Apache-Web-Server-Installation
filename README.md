<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies the management of systems, applications, and services. It allows you to define your infrastructure as code, making it easier to deploy, manage, and maintain your systems consistently and efficiently.</p>
<p>A playbook in Ansible is a YAML file that contains a series of tasks to be executed on specified hosts. Playbooks are the heart of Ansible's operations, allowing you to automate complex processes through simple, human-readable instructions.</p>
<h2>Structure of Playbook</h2>
<p>Structure of an Ansible Playbook
A typical Ansible playbook includes:
<li>Hosts: Specifies the target machines.</li>
<li>asks: A list of actions to be performed.</li>
<li>Modules: The tools used to execute tasks (e.g., yum, apt, copy, etc.).</li>
<li>Variables: Customizable parameters that can be reused.</li>
<li>Handlers: Tasks that are triggered by other tasks.</li>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<li>Application Deployment: Automate the deployment of applications across multiple servers, ensuring consistency and reducing human error.</li>
<li>Configuration Management: Maintain system configurations across environments (e.g., development, testing, production) to ensure they match organizational standards.</li>
<li>System Provisioning: Automatically set up new servers with the necessary software, configurations, and security policies.</li>
<li>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Integrate with CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment of code changes to production environments.</li>
<li>Cloud Automation: Manage and provision cloud resources (e.g., AWS, Azure) using Ansible playbooks to create a scalable infrastructure.</li>
<li>Security Compliance: Ensure systems are configured correctly and comply with security policies by automatically applying security patches and configurations.</li>
